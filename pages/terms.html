      <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Service Connect. These Terms of Service govern your use of our platform. By accessing or using our website, you agree to be bound by these terms.
      </p>
      <h3>User Accounts</h3>
      <p>
        To use certain features of our platform, you must register for an account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and for all activities that occur under your account.
      </p>
      <h3>Platform Use</h3>
      <p>
        Service Connect acts solely as an intermediary between clients and service providers. We do not provide services directly. Clients post requests, and service providers browse and respond to these requests. Communication and agreements are managed directly between the two parties.
      </p>
      <h3>Prohibited Activities</h3>
      <p>
        Users are prohibited from engaging in any activities that may harm the platform or other users. This includes, but is not limited to, fraudulent behavior, harassment, and the distribution of harmful content.
      </p>
      <h3>Disclaimers</h3>
      <p>
        While we strive to maintain a secure and efficient platform, Service Connect makes no guarantees regarding the reliability or accuracy of the information provided by users. Use the platform at your own risk.
      </p>
      <h3>Changes to the Terms</h3>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page and will become effective immediately upon posting.
